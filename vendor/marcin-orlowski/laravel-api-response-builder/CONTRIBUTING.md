 **before doing any work**. This will help us save your time in case I'd not be accept PR either completely or in proposed form.
 But if all is good and clear then follow common routine:

 * fork the project,
 * checkout `dev` branch (NOT `master`!)
 * create your own branch from there,
 * do your changes,
 * write unit tests for your changes,
 * ensure **ALL** tests pass,
 * send pull request,
 * glory :)
