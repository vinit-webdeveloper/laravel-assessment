## Response structure ##

 Predictability, simplicity and no special-case is the key of the `ResponseBuilder` and all responses created by
 this library **guarantee** consistent JSON structure by design.
 
 By default response always contain at least the following elements:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "code": 0,
  "locale": "en",
  "message": "OK",
  "data": null
}
```

 where

  * `success` (**boolean**) indicates API method failure or success,
  * `code` (**int**) is your own return code (usually used when returning error message or other failure),
  * `locale` (**string**) represents locale used for returned error message (obtained automatically via 
    `\App::getLocale()`). This helps processing the response if you support multiple languages,
  * `message` (**string**) human readable message that is ready to display and explains human readable explanation 
    of the `code` value,
  * `data` (**object**|**array**|**null**) if you return any additional data with your reply, it would end here.
    If no extra data is needed, that key still be present in the response with `null` value.

 **NOTE:** If you need to return other/different elements in the above structure (not in your `data`),
 see [Manipulating Response Object](#manipulating-response-object) chapter for detailed information about how
 to achieve this.

----

## Return Codes ##

 All return codes are integers however the meaning of the code is fully up to you. The only exception
 is `0` (zero) which **ALWAYS** means **success** and you cannot use `0` with `error()` methods (but
 you can have other codes for success than `0` if needed).

#### Code Ranges ####

 In one of my projects we had multiple APIs chained together (so one API called another, remote API). I wanted to be able to chain
 API invocations in the way that in case of problems (and cascading failure) I still would able to tell which one failed first. 
 For example our API client app calls method of publicly exposed API "A". That API "A" internally calls method of completely
 different and separate API "B". Under the hood API "B" delegates some work and talks to API "C". When something go wrong and
 "C"'s method fail, client shall see "C"'s error code and error message, not the "A"'s. To achieve this each API you chain return
 unique error codes and the values are unique per whole chain To support that `ResponseBuilder` features code ranges, allowing 
 you to configure `min_code` and `max_code` you want to be allowed to use in given API. `ResponseBuilder` will ensure no values not
 from that range is ever returned, so to make the whole chain "clear", you only need to properly assign non-overlapping ranges to 
 your APIs and `ResponseBuilder` do the rest. Any attempt to violate code range ends up with exception thrown.

 **IMPORTANT:** first `20` codes in your range (from `0` to `19` inclusive) are reserved for `ResponseBuilder` internals and 
 must not be used directly nor assigned to your codes.

 **NOTE:** code ranges cannot be turned off, but if you do not need it or you just have one API or need no chaining, then just
 set `max_code` in your configuration file to some very high value if needed or defaults do not fit.

----

## Exposed Methods ##

 Starting from version 6.4, `ResponseBuilder` uses new API implementation that uses 
 [Builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern), which is far more flexible that previous bag of methods.
 
### Helpers ###

 But while Builder is pretty proverful interface, if you need to return just success or error, without too many additional data
 attached, using it may look like overkill, therefore there are two helper methods (from old API) that serve as shortcuts
 for reporting success or failure:
 
 * `success($data, $api_code, $placeholders, $http_code, $json_opts)`
 
    Returns success indicating message. You can ommit `$api_code` to fall back to default code for `OK`). All params are
    optional. Usage example:
    
    ```php
    return ResponseBuilder::success();
    ```
    
  * `public static function error(int $api_code, array $placeholders = null, $data = null, int $http_code = null, int $json_opts = null)`

    Returns error indicating response. `$api_code` must not equal to value indicating `OK` (`ApiCodes::OK()`), all other params
    are optional.
    
    ```php
    return ResponseBuilder::error(ApiCodes::SOMETHING_FAILED);
    ```

### Builder ###

To obtain instance of the Builder, two static methods: `asSuccess()` and `asError()` are now exposed. For example, the following
 code would return response indicating a success, with additional data and custom HTTP code:

```php
return ResponseBuilder::asSuccess()
      ->withData($data)
      ->withHttpCode(HttpResponse::HTTP_CREATED)
      ->build();
```

 For simplicity of use, it's recommended to add the following `use` to your code (you can also use
 [namespace aliasing](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php)):

    use MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilder;

 If you dislike typing `ResponseBuilder` you can use [namespace aliasing](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php):

 Builder static methods:
 
 * `asSuccess($api_code)`: Returns Builder instance configured to return success indicating message. 
   You can ommit `$api_code` to fall back to default code for `OK` (`ApiCodes::OK()`).
 * `asError($api_code)`: Returns Builder instance configured to produce error indicating response. `$api_code`
   must not equal to value indicating `OK` (`ApiCodes::OK()`).
 
 In both cases `api_code` (**int**) is any integer value you want to be returned as `code` in final response.
 
 Parameter setters:
 
 * `withHttpCode($code)`: (**int**) valid HTTP return code (see `HttpResponse` class for useful constants). For 
   `success()` responses, `$http_code` must be in range from 200 to 299 (inclusive), while for `error()` it must be in 
   range from 400 to 599 (inclusive) otherwise `\InvalidArgumentException` will be thrown. HTTP codes from 3xx pool 
   (redirection) are not allowed. Please see [W3 specification](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)
   for more information about all HTTP codes and their meaning.
 * `withData($data)`: (**object**|**array**|**null**) data you want to be returned in your response in `data` node,
 * `withJsonOptions($opts)`: (**int**) data-to-json conversion options as
   [documented](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php). Pass `null` for 
   default `ResponseBuilder::DEFAULT_ENCODING_OPTIONS` ([source](../src/ResponseBuilder.php)). Please see
   [configuration](../config/response_builder.php) file and config's `encoding_options` too.
 * `withMessage($message)`: (**string**) custom message to be returned as part of error response 
   (avoid, use error code mapping feature).
 * `withPlaceholders($placeholders)`: (**array**) array of placeholders as expected by `Lang::get()` while building
   response `message` based on localization files (as configured in i.e. `map`) or strings with placeholders.
 * `withHttpHeaders($headers)`
 
 Once all is arguments are passed, call `build()` to conclude building and have final `HttpResponse` object returned.

 **IMPORTANT:** To enforce constant JSON structure of the response, `data` node is always an JSON object, therefore passing
 anything but `object` or `array` to `withData()` would trigger internal type casting. There's no smart logic here, just
 ordinary `$data = (object)$data;`. The only exception are classes configured with "classes" mapping (see configuration
 details). In such case configured conversion method is called on the provided object and result is returned instead. 
 Several classes pre-configured but you can add additional classes just by creating entry in configuration `converter` mapping.
 See [Data Conversion](#data-conversion) for more information.

----

## Data Conversion ##

 `ResponseBuilder` can save you some work by automatically converting objects into array representation. For example, having
 `ResponseBuilder` configured to auto-convet objects of Eloquent's `Model` class and passing object of that class either directly
 using `withData()` or as part of bigger structurre) will have it converted to JSON format automatically:

```php
$flight = App\Flight::where(...)->first();
return ResponseBuilder::success($flight);
```

 will return:

```json
{
   "item": {
      "airline": "lot",
      "flight_number": "lo123",
      ...
   }
}
```

 Or you have more data, then pass `Collection`:

```php
$flights = App\Flight::where(...)->get();
return ResponseBuilder::success($flights);
```

 which would return array of objects:

```json
{
   "items": [
      {
         "airline": "lot",
         "flight_number": "lo123",
         ...
      },{
         "airline": "american",
         "flight_number": "am456",
         ...
      }
   ]
}
```

 The whole functionality is configurable using `converter` array:

```php
'converter' => [
    \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model::class          => [
        'handler' => \MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\Converters\ToArrayConverter::class,
        // 'pri'     => 0,
    ],
    \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection::class     => [
        'handler' => \MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\Converters\ToArrayConverter::class,
        // 'pri'     => 0,
    ],
],
```

 where parameters mean:
 
 * `handler` (mandatory) specifies class name that implements `ConverterContract` interface that is capable of doing the
   conversion of object of given class.
 * `pri` (optional) is an integer being entry's priority (default `0`). Entries with higher values will be matched first. If you got one 
   class extending another and you want to support both of them with separate configuration, then you **must** ensure child 
   class has higher priority than it's parent class.   

 The above configures two classes (`Model` and `Collection`). Whenever object of that class is spotted, method specified in
 `method` key would be called on that object and data that method returns will be returned in JSON object.
 
 **IMPORTANT:** For each object `ResponseBuilder` checks if we have configuration entry matching **exactly** object class 
 name. If no such mapping is found, then the whole configuration is walked again, but this time we take inheritance into 
 consideration and use `instanceof` to see if we have a match, therefore you need to pay attention your config specifies
 lower priority (i.e. `-10`) for all the generic handlers. Doing that ensures any more specific handler will be checked
 first. If no handler is found for given object, the exception is thrown. 

 When you pass the array it will be walked recursively and the conversion will take place on all known elements as well:

```php
$data = [
   'flight' = App\Flight::where(...)->first(),
   'planes' = App\Plane::where(...)->get(),
];
```

 would produce the following response (contrary to the previous examples, source array keys are preserved):

```json
{
   "flight": {
      "airline": "lot",
      "flight_number": "lo123",
      ...
   },
   "planes": [
      {
         "make": "airbus",
         "registration": "F-GUGJ",
         ...
      },{
         "make": "boeing",
         "registration": "VT-ANG",
         ...
      }
   ]
}
```

----

## Requirements ##

 Minimum requirements:

  * PHP 7.2+ with [json extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php),
  * Laravel v6.x or v7.x (see [legacy](docs/legacy.md) for Laravel 5.x support).

----

## Installation and Configuration ##

 To install `ResponseBuilder` all you need to do is to open your shell/cmd and do:

    composer require marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder:<VERSION>

 Where `<VERSION>` string consists of `MAJOR` and `MINOR` release numbers. For
 example if current relase is 6.4.13, you need to invoke:

    composer require marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder:6.4

 which will add  the dependency at the release 6.3 + all the bugfixing releses
 (`6.3.*`) but won't automatically pull 6.4 even if available, unless
 `composer.json` is updated manually.

 If you want to use different configuration than `ResponseBuilder` defaults,
 publish and edit configuration file as described in [Configuration file](config.md)
 documentation.

#### Setup ####

 `ResponseBuilder` supports Laravel's auto-discovery feature and it's ready to use once 
 installed.

#### ApiCodes class ####

 To keep your source readable and clear, it's strongly recommended to create separate class
 `ApiCode.php` (i.e. in `app/`) and keep all codes there as `public const`. This way you protect
 yourself from using wrong code or save your time in case you will need to refactor code
 range in future. For example, your imaginary `app/ApiCode.php` can look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class ApiCode {
   public const SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG = 250;
}
```


#### ResponseBuilder Configuration ####

 Package configuration can be found in `config/response_builder.php` file and
 each of its element is heavily documented in the file, so please take a moment
 and read it.

 Supported configuration keys (all keys **MUST** be present in config file):

 * `min_code` (int) lowest allowed code for assigned code range (inclusive)
 * `max_code` (int) highest allowed code for assigned code range (inclusive)
 * `map` (array) maps error codes to localization string keys.

 Code to message mapping example:

```php
'map' => [
    ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG => 'api.something_went_wrong',
],
```

 If given error code is not present in `map`, `ResponseBuilder` will provide fallback message automatically
 (default message is like "Error #xxx"). This means it's perfectly fine to have whole `map` array empty in
 your config, however you **MUST** have `map` key present nonetheless:

    'map' => [],

 Also, read [Overriding built-in messages](#overriding-built-in-messages) to see how to override built-in
 messages.

 **NOTE:** Config file may grow in future so if you are not using defaults, then on package upgrades
 check CHANGES.md to see if there're new configuration options. If so, and you already have config
 published, then you need to look into dist config file in `vendor/marcin-orlowski/laravel-api-response-builder/config/`
 folder and grab new version of config file.

----

## Messages and Localization ##

 `ResponseBuilder` is designed with localization in mind so default approach is you just set it up
 once and most things should happen automatically, which also includes creating human readable error messages.
 As described in `Configuration` section, once you get `map` configured, you most likely will not
 be in need to manually refer error messages - `ResponseBuilder` will do that for you and you optionally
 just need to pass array with placeholders' substitution (hence the order of arguments for `errorXXX()`
 methods). `ResponseBuilder` utilised standard Laravel's `Lang` class to deal with messages, so all
 localization features are supported.

----

## Handling Exceptions API way ##

 Properly designed REST API should never hit consumer with anything but JSON. While it looks like easy task,
 there's always chance for unexpected issue to occur. So we need to expect unexpected and be prepared when
 it hit the fan. This means not only things like uncaught exception but also Laravel's maintenance mode can
 pollute returned API responses which is unfortunately pretty common among badly written APIs. Do not be
 one of them, and take care of that in advance with couple of easy steps.
 With Laravel this can be achieved with custom Exception Handler and `ResponseBuilder` comes with ready-to-use
 Handler as well. See [Exception Handling with Response Builder](exceptions.md) for easy setup information.

----

## Manipulating Response Object ##

 If you need to return more fields in response object you can simply extend `ResponseBuilder` class
 and override `buildResponse()` method.

### Custom response structure ###

 For example, you want to get rid of `locale` field and add server time and timezone to returned
 responses. First, create `MyResponseBuilder.php` file in `app/` folder (both location and class
 name can be anything you wish, just remember to adjust the namespace too) and override
 `buildResponse()` method which builds normalized response array for all the helper methods.
 So the class content should be as follow:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class MyResponseBuilder extends MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilder
{
   protected static function buildResponse(bool $success, int $api_code, 
                                           $message_or_api_code, array $lang_args = null,
                                           $data = null, array $debug_data = null): array
   {
      // tell ResponseBuilder to do all the heavy lifting first
      $response = parent::buildResponse($success, $api_code, $message_or_api_code, $lang_args, $data, $debug_data);

      // then do all the tweaks you need
      $date = new DateTime();
      $response['timestamp'] = $date->getTimestamp();
      $response['timezone'] = $date->getTimezone();

      unset($response['locale']);

      // finally, return what $response holds
      return $response;
   }

}
```

 and from now on use `MyResponseBuilder` class instead of `ResponseBuilder`. As all responses are
 always produced with use of `buildResponse()` internally, your **all** responses will be affected
 the same way. For example:
 
```php
MyResponseBuilder::success();
```

 which should then return your desired JSON structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "code": 0,
  "message": "OK",
  "timestamp": 1272509157,
  "timezone": "UTC",
  "data": null
}
```

 and

```php
$data = [ 'foo'=>'bar ];
return MyResponseBuilder::errorWithData(ApiCode::SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG, $data);
```

 would produce:

```json
{
   "success": false,
   "code": 250,
   "message": "Error #250",
   "timestamp": 1272509157,
   "timezone": "UTC",
   "data": {
      "foo": "bar"
   }
}
```

### Overriding code to message conversion ###

`ResponseBuilder` automatically provides human readable error messages for each API code used but if for any
reason you want to take control on this, you can now provide own implementation of `ResponseBuilder::getMessageForApiCode()`.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

class MyResponseBuilder extends MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\ResponseBuilder
{
   protected static function getMessageForApiCode(bool $success, int $api_code, array $lang_args = null): string
   {
       return "My cool message for code {$api_code}";
   }
}
```

Please see current implementation for `getMessageForApiCode()` for details how to correctly obtain localization string key etc.


----

## Overriding built-in messages ##

 At the moment `ResponseBuilder` provides few built-in messages (see [src/ErrorCode.php](src/ErrorCode.php)):
 one is used for success code `0` and another provides fallback message for codes without custom mapping. If for
 any reason you want to override them, simply map these codes in your `map` config using codes from package
 reserved range:

```php
MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\BaseApiCodes::OK() => 'my_messages.ok',
```

 and from now on, each `success()` will be returning your message instead of built-in one.

 To override default error message used when given error code has no entry in `map`, add the following:

```php
MarcinOrlowski\ResponseBuilder\BaseApiCodes::NO_ERROR_MESSAGE() => 'my_messages.default_error_message',
````

 You can use `:api_code` placeholder in the message and it will be substituted actual error code value.
